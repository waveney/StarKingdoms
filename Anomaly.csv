Thirty-two scattered cities dot the vast, untamed landscape. The cities are heavily defended, heavy weaponry mounted atop their great walls. The land for a few miles around each city has been cleared into a killing field, and scorch marks are visible on the ground from where the city guns have struck.  It isn’t clear at first glance what threat the weapons were designed to defend against, but whatever it is the inhabitants clearly take them seriously.  Low-orbit shuttles travel regularly between the cities.
In addition to the relatively few cities scattered on the planet's surface, there are a number of much smaller townships, around 300 in total.  These also have ""killing fields"" around them, however these are much smaller.

This is the homeworld of the Wombles.
The planet is mostly covered by a giant ocean with many small islands.  There is one large crescent-shaped continent which is mostly in the southern hemisphere but with one horn extending across the equator.  The vegetation is mostly low lying but with clumps of taller plants.  Rolling across the plains are, what appear to be, numerous species of tumbleweed. The settlements have few above ground buildings but sensors reveal that there are numerous tunnels below ground around the buildings.  One exception is a settlement around what appears to be a giant grounded starship where above ground buildings are the norm although tunnels are still present.  The inhabitants appear to travel between distant settlements by means of catapult launched gliders.

The Skylands - Inhospitable Minerals ?
From orbit, the small planet of Sanara looks like a cloudy ocean world with two distinct sandstone coloured poles, wrapped round with a dramatic ring interspersed with chunky moons.

Sanara
 It is close to the sun and has a high orbit speed giving short days and nights. Around the equator, massive spiral steam cloud-banks constantly shift and warp, like gigantic serpents circling the world, but they calm down and become smaller and gentler as the clouds reach the poles. Deep beneath the waves can be seen red glowing dots where the molten core of the world is exposed. 

The only visible landmasses are at the two poles of the planet, where the conditions are cooler and more comfortable for life. Each pole resembles a huge sandy coloured rock of land that are orbited by lots of smaller islands. There is little vegetation on the surface, but on each of the landmasses are thousands and thousands of small holes. If you were to zoom right in as far as you could, you'd be able to see that these holes are artificial, though not very neatly organised. Some are crude, but many are ornate openings that lead to cool underground cities and caves. At night, the holes would be lit up by a soft blue glow from the luminous fungi that grows underground.

Only one significant settlement appears to be visible from orbit on the northern landmass. It is a recent construction, but still looks like little more than strategically stacked junk and rocks. The specially flattened surfaces in the settlement appear to be the only viable places to land safely.

COMPLETE: The Space Maggots are thoroughly productive creatures, but they might be a touch boring (pun intended!).  They spend all their lives, or at least as long as they have been observed, consuming small parts of an asteroid.  Whilst initially fascinating as a new form of life, the maggots unfortunately don’t seem able to absorb complex forms of political thought, or indeed any thought at all.
In the interest of being thorough in their examination, a decision is agreed upon to examine one of the bodies of the maggots, to see if a dissection may reveal any further secrets.  This proves to be an excellent decision, another victory for collective decision making, when the digestive system of the maggot reveals a viable quantity of adianite. It seems that the maggot is unable to process this mineral, and so it has built up over time.  Perhaps it is in fact what killed it?  A quick scan of the nearby asteroid confirms that traces of adianite are present throughout, but it would take a very long time to manually acquire anything useful.",,,
