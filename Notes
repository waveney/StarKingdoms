Future Hooks:
1) Players can be GMs etc in different games (untested)
2) Nebulae can be thicker requiring more/better sensors
3) Projects can be abandoned and resumed later (penalty to be decided upon)
4) Many things from Asteroid mines, Minefields etc can be "advanced", they appear the same to other factions, but get more money, delever more damage etc.
5) Link Ids can be annoymised so you don't know what connects to what until you explore them
6) Most things can be leveled eg minefileds, outposts etc

From: Major Tsymbaliuk #8,238
To: Captain Ilku of the Fongari fleet
It is good to meet you.  We are also unfamiliar with your people.  We do come from the Nebula.

Kaptain Kachanov is not authorised to speak for the Mammotic Federation, the matter has been passed to me.

We have recently met the Wombles and have been folowing them here.

What size are you?  Mighty or puny?  I am 4.2 meters tall and 5.5 meters long - not counting my trunk.
