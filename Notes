17 Where has X come from (from last line in things history) - add to see after movement (filter for unknown wormhole)
129 Combat
173 Edit World font size mobile - see a chat gm 21/11
224 Meetups - armies on Different Planets see Todo 1
288 What about an "Organisation specific map" that shows the locations of branches/offices in one colour, then the effective range from them 
    in different colours so you can see that, say, range 1 is yellow, range 2 is orange, range 3 is dark orange and range 4 is red or something like that?
297 The new Map trade history is useful, can I request some "turn gating options" 
    to limit what we can see, its not a problem just yet, but I can forsee mine getting very long very quick (Ross)
318 Planet/moon Day length - part of own system development code - also better planet image gallery
352 New ship (copy of) extra page for name before project save

Star:
Luminosity:                        L = M^3
Diameter:                           D = M^0.74
Surface Temperature:       T = M^0.505
Lifetime:                             V = M^-2.5
Habitable zone (inner) :     R = sqrt(L) x 0.95
Habitable zone (outer):      R = sqrt(L) x 1.37

Planet system:
Inner limit:        I = 0.1 x M
Outer limit:      O = 40 x M
Frost Line:       R = 4.85 x sqrt(L)



Planets

Planet-maker: G = M/R^2 = R(P)
Escape Velocity: V = sqrt(M/R)
Surface area: A = 4piR^2
Circumference: 2piR
Volume: 4/3piR^3


Terestial planets:
Equations used in this video:

Planet maker: G = M/R^2 = R(P)
Escape Velocity = sqrt(M/R)

(G = Gravity relative to earth
M = Mass relative to earth
R = Radius relative to earth
P = Density relative to earth)


Circumference = 2piR
Surface Area = 4piR^2
Volume = 4/3piR^3

Orbits:

Eccentricity Indicator: 0.584*N^(-1.2)
Periapsis: a(1-e)
Apoapsis: a(1+e)
Orbital Period: sqrt(a^3/M)
Orbital Velocity: sqrt(M/R)

Q1 system type single star, double star.
if binary either S-type - all go round one star, other star is a VERY LONG way out
or P-type - stars tightly coupled then position the planets futher out
Hot Jupiter tightly into parent (retrograde) gap then habitble planets
Average habitable system 5-9 planets (inc ast belts) 

13% F, 34% G, 53% K
1.04-1.4 S, 0.6-1.04 S, 0.45-0.8S
