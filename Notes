17 Where has X come from (from last line in things history) - add to see after movement (filter for unknown wormhole)
129 Combat
173 Edit World font size mobile - see a chat gm 21/11
224 Meetups - armies on Different Planets see Todo 1
288 What about an "Organisation specific map" that shows the locations of branches/offices in one colour, then the effective range from them 
    in different colours so you can see that, say, range 1 is yellow, range 2 is orange, range 3 is dark orange and range 4 is red or something like that?
297 The new Map trade history is useful, can I request some "turn gating options" 
    to limit what we can see, its not a problem just yet, but I can forsee mine getting very long very quick (Ross)
318 Planet/moon Day length - part of own system development code - also better planet image gallery
352 New ship (copy of) extra page for name before project save
358 Luke's trade goods - achatgm 28/3/ @13:06
444 fed heavy security not visible on ground
451 Judith wormholes
458 Multiple fighters
461 b-thor 17/6@14:36 /EMN??
468 Military branches / offices should show on the "Meetups" page as they have the potential to deploy forces.
527 Ship: Exploratory Fighter Squadron has no System Setup - Call Richard...
537 Vasou and ARV GXE links
===543 start of turn 22
550 Outposts - in YPK not appear 
551 Ship: Copy of Exploratory Fighter Squadron has no System Setup - Call Richard... see 527 happened again t24
552 refresh all own system scans every turn
553 scans active scan all except districts etc 

=== 579 start of turn 23
583 follow unknown?
588 Vasou 25/8 abr - As per usual, space survey's havent updated the pages for the individual systems. 
    Using the main map for wormholes, but would also like to know the details of the asteroids in one system?
592 bar plan details anomaly twice QTE - also link missing from map QTE - ELV??

622 GM option to select dist/off for devastation.

Star:
Luminosity:                        L = M^3
Diameter:                           D = M^0.74
Surface Temperature:       T = M^0.505
Lifetime:                             V = M^-2.5
Habitable zone (inner) :     R = sqrt(L) x 0.95
Habitable zone (outer):      R = sqrt(L) x 1.37

Planet system:
Inner limit:        I = 0.1 x M
Outer limit:      O = 40 x M
Frost Line:       R = 4.85 x sqrt(L)



Planets

Planet-maker: G = M/R^2 = R(P)
Escape Velocity: V = sqrt(M/R)
Surface area: A = 4piR^2
Circumference: 2piR
Volume: 4/3piR^3


Terestial planets:
Equations used in this video:

Planet maker: G = M/R^2 = R(P)
Escape Velocity = sqrt(M/R)

(G = Gravity relative to earth
M = Mass relative to earth
R = Radius relative to earth
P = Density relative to earth)


Circumference = 2piR
Surface Area = 4piR^2
Volume = 4/3piR^3

Orbits:

Eccentricity Indicator: 0.584*N^(-1.2)
Periapsis: a(1-e)
Apoapsis: a(1+e)
Orbital Period: sqrt(a^3/M)
Orbital Velocity: sqrt(M/R)

Q1 system type single star, double star.
if binary either S-type - all go round one star, other star is a VERY LONG way out
or P-type - stars tightly coupled then position the planets futher out
Hot Jupiter tightly into parent (retrograde) gap then habitble planets
Average habitable system 5-9 planets (inc ast belts) 

13% F, 34% G, 53% K
1.04-1.4 S, 0.6-1.04 S, 0.45-0.8S
