From: Major Tsymbaliuk #8,238
To: Captain Ilku of the Fongari fleet
It is good to meet you.  We are also unfamiliar with your people.  We do come from the Nebula.

Kaptain Kachanov is not authorised to speak for the Mammotic Federation, the matter has been passed to me.

We have recently met the Wombles and have been folowing them here.

What size are you?  Mighty or puny?  I am 4.2 meters tall and 5.5 meters long - not counting my trunk.

The escort is providing cover for the Snow Deliver to deploy both armies to the surface, they want to take control of the planet.   Mammots ships currently have no capability to Warp out.

Major General Vladivosky #25, is leading a Limited Miltary Operation to liberate Belkovsky (EFG) from the oppresive Fongari.

He is willing to accept the surrender of the puny Fongari, they will be welcome as slaves.
