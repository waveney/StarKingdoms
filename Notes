Has_Tech for projects - use turn number
Distict count for projects use world data
Redo forward projections 
  - tech
  - finance
  - districts
  - things
  - logistics
Projects complete - in future
  - tech
  - finance
  - districts
  - things
  - logistics
New projects - use projected values
  - tech
  - core techs

effect of changing when a project completes on a projection 
effects of cancelling on projection
