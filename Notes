288 What about an "Organisation specific map" that shows the locations of branches/offices in one colour, then the effective range from them 
    in different colours so you can see that, say, range 1 is yellow, range 2 is orange, range 3 is dark orange and range 4 is red or something like that?
292 Trait Organic Units - Game Chat 15/2 @17:10 - salvage aspects
297 The new Map trade history is useful, can I request some "turn gating options" 
    to limit what we can see, its not a problem just yet, but I can forsee mine getting very long very quick (Ross)
298 If you have a branch on someone else's outpost, do you have space eyes in that system?  Ditto for ground branches?
318 Planet/moon Day length - part of own system development code - also better planet image gallery

332 Kage's ind district
333 Sounds like a cached data issue
I don't know why though since it's telling me you scanned L2 on turn 11
So I'd have expected that to update the cached survey
334 Kage 11/3 @9:11 Looking at Explorer 5's history, it didn't log that it performed the survey either, so something is definitely odd with it
335 Refit/Repair etc
336 Orbital Repair Yards
337 Another one for the list - Fed have a branch on the Clan outpost in UUW but don't have vision of the system. see #298
