Scientific Breakthroughs from Science Points are now automated

IF you have enough science points to do anything, THEN an additionl item on the main player menu "Spend Sceince Points" will appear.

Select the way you want to spend them.  They are normally spent on your turn - so you can change your mind until turns are processed.

If for some obscure reason, you want the tech instantly.  Once the breakthrough has been selected.  There will be a "Do now" option - no changes of mind...

During turn processing science points are spent instantly at the start of the turn so you can use the tech that turn.

One minor note: You cannot use points to raise a tech more than one level per turn.
