274 Rules Queries Feb 10 - 22:01
278 Judith transfer HTX from Ross
279 Bar - VGW
280 Ross 11/2 @16:57
285 Easy ways to stop/pause Projects/operations/instructions
287 Ross 13/2 @10:15 (repeat)
288 What about an "Organisation specific map" that shows the locations of branches/offices in one colour, then the effective range from them 
    in different colours so you can see that, say, range 1 is yellow, range 2 is orange, range 3 is dark orange and range 4 is red or something like that?
289 Office New Org - check how many
292 Trait Organic Units - Game Chat 15/2 @17:10 - salvage aspects
297 The new Map trade history is useful, can I request some "turn gating options" 
    to limit what we can see, its not a problem just yet, but I can forsee mine getting very long very quick (Ross)
298 If you have a branch on someone else's outpost, do you have space eyes in that system?  Ditto for ground branches?
299 Meetups - how hard would it be to have on the meetups screen a flag for each unit to say if they're carrying something or not?  
    Then we can go into the unit and unload fighters etc.
301 targeting computers module yesterday, will I be able to edit that module to provide a +5 boost to "To hit" in the same way Point Defences adds to Evasion?
302 Space Faurna - hostile
