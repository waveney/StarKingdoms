17 Where has X come from (from last line in things history) - add to see after movement (filter for unknown wormhole)
129 Combat
173 Edit World font size mobile - see a chat gm 21/11
224 Meetups - armies on Different Planets see Todo 1
288 What about an "Organisation specific map" that shows the locations of branches/offices in one colour, then the effective range from them 
    in different colours so you can see that, say, range 1 is yellow, range 2 is orange, range 3 is dark orange and range 4 is red or something like that?
297 The new Map trade history is useful, can I request some "turn gating options" 
    to limit what we can see, its not a problem just yet, but I can forsee mine getting very long very quick (Ross)
318 Planet/moon Day length - part of own system development code - also better planet image gallery

588 Vasou 25/8 abr - As per usual, space survey's havent updated the pages for the individual systems. 
    Using the main map for wormholes, but would also like to know the details of the asteroids in one system?

Star:
Luminosity:                        L = M^3
Diameter:                           D = M^0.74
Surface Temperature:       T = M^0.505
Lifetime:                             V = M^-2.5
Habitable zone (inner) :     R = sqrt(L) x 0.95
Habitable zone (outer):      R = sqrt(L) x 1.37

Planet system:
Inner limit:        I = 0.1 x M
Outer limit:      O = 40 x M
Frost Line:       R = 4.85 x sqrt(L)



Planets

Planet-maker: G = M/R^2 = R(P)
Escape Velocity: V = sqrt(M/R)
Surface area: A = 4piR^2
Circumference: 2piR
Volume: 4/3piR^3


Terestial planets:
Equations used in this video:

Planet maker: G = M/R^2 = R(P)
Escape Velocity = sqrt(M/R)

(G = Gravity relative to earth
M = Mass relative to earth
R = Radius relative to earth
P = Density relative to earth)


Circumference = 2piR
Surface Area = 4piR^2
Volume = 4/3piR^3

Orbits:

Eccentricity Indicator: 0.584*N^(-1.2)
Periapsis: a(1-e)
Apoapsis: a(1+e)
Orbital Period: sqrt(a^3/M)
Orbital Velocity: sqrt(M/R)

Q1 system type single star, double star.
if binary either S-type - all go round one star, other star is a VERY LONG way out
or P-type - stars tightly coupled then position the planets futher out
Hot Jupiter tightly into parent (retrograde) gap then habitble planets
Average habitable system 5-9 planets (inc ast belts) 

13% F, 34% G, 53% K
1.04-1.4 S, 0.6-1.04 S, 0.45-0.8S
