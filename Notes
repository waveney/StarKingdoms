#2 Something went wrong on Operations, Specifically, The Archons explored a wormhole (ASC into TBA) the operation shows as 1/1 Started last turn and STILL as 1/1 Complete this turn ⁠ascendancy⁠
#3 Also Operations, The Elysian Order, Progress looks wrong, I started it turn 1, so should be 3/4 this turn but is showing 4/4 to complete this turn. ⁠ascendancy⁠
#4 If I try and do the Study Anomaly Operation using (again) The Archon's on the TBA (for the floaters) it says I don't know about them
