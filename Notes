    in different colours so you can see that, say, range 1 is yellow, range 2 is orange, range 3 is dark orange and range 4 is red or something like that?

Maybe from stopping scanning?
332 Kage's ind district
333 Sounds like a cached data issue
I don't know why though since it's telling me you scanned L2 on turn 11
So I'd have expected that to update the cached survey

335 Refit/Repair etc
336 Orbital Repair Yards
