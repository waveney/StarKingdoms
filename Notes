Future Hooks:
1) Players can be GMs etc in different games (untested)
2) Nebulae can be thicker requiring more/better sensors
3) Projects can be abandoned and resumed later (penalty to be decided upon)
4) Many things from Asteroid mines, Minefields etc can be "advanced", they appear the same to other factions, but get more money, delever more damage etc.
5) Link Ids can be annoymised so you don't know what connects to what until you explore them
6) Most things can be leveled eg minefileds, outposts etc
7) The Logistics cost of units at Home can be halved (Always or by a tech)
