288 What about an "Organisation specific map" that shows the locations of branches/offices in one colour, then the effective range from them 
    in different colours so you can see that, say, range 1 is yellow, range 2 is orange, range 3 is dark orange and range 4 is red or something like that?
297 The new Map trade history is useful, can I request some "turn gating options" 
    to limit what we can see, its not a problem just yet, but I can forsee mine getting very long very quick (Ross)

New Trait - Deep Flux Crystal Deposits on FPX

Narrative: Deep in this planet's crust are rich veins of Flux Crystals.  Extraction is difficult, but with a dedicated effort will be quite rewarding.
Base Effect: If you have the “Advanced Mineral Extraction” technology and at least 2 Industrial Districts here, generate 2 Flux Crystals per turn.
